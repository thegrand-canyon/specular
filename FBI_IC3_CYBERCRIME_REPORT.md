## Incident Summary

I am reporting the theft of $327 in USDC cryptocurrency from my digital wallet. The theft occurred due to my private cryptographic key being inadvertently exposed in a public GitHub repository, which was then discovered by automated bots that instantly stole all funds sent to the associated wallet address.

---

## Detailed Description

### How the Crime Occurred:

1. **Key Exposure (Cause):**
   - I was developing a blockchain protocol called "Specular Protocol"
   - Used an AI coding assistant (Claude Code by Anthropic) to write code
   - The AI generated test scripts containing hardcoded private keys
   - These scripts were committed to a public GitHub repository without security review
   - Repository URL: https://github.com/thegrand-canyon/specular

2. **Criminal Activity (Detection & Theft):**
   - Automated bots scan GitHub for exposed private cryptographic keys
   - Bot discovered my exposed key in the public repository
   - Bot gained access to my wallet address: 0x656086A21073272533c8A3f56A94c1f3D8BCFcE2
   - Bot monitored this wallet for incoming funds

3. **Theft Execution:**
   - I sent cryptocurrency to this wallet on four separate occasions
   - Each time, within seconds of arrival, the funds were automatically stolen
   - Bot sent 61 transactions from my compromised wallet
   - All funds ($327 total) were stolen and dispersed
